### Picklist: 

* Can be custom defined values or values from a global value set. If a global set is used, then the picklist is restricted. A restricted picklist means that only the values defined can be used. Other values cannot be inserted even via the API.

### Dependent picklist:

* Allows one Picklist to be filtered by the values in another Picklist or checkbox field.

* Custom object picklist fields can be controlling or dependent.

### Global Value Set:
