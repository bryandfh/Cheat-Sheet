# Workflow and Process Automation

### Order of execution:
A helpful way of remembering the basics is Very Angry Admins Work Pretty Efficiently :pencil: :
* Very => Validation Rules
* Angry => Assignment Rules
* Admins => Auto-Response Rules
* Work => Workflow
* Pretty => Process
* Efficiently => Escalation Rules

### Workflow Rules Evaluation

* When a record is created.
* Created, and everytime it's edited.
  * The rule will fire every time the record is updated even though the record may have already met the workflow criteria.
* Created, and any time itâ€™s edited to subsequently meet criteria:
  * When a new record is created, or if an existing record is changed from not meeting the rule criteria to meeting the criteria, the workflow rule will fire.
 
### Rule Criteria and Formula Evaluations
It's the logic to determine if the rule should fire. There are 2 ways to define the logic: Criteria are met or Formula evaluates to True.

#### Criteria Are Met
Filter logic with AND,OR,NOT operators.

#### Formula Evaluates to True
The formula return True or False. If True, then the rule is triggered.

### Workflow Capabilities
Workflows and approval processes include the capability to generate the following types of actions:

* Create Tasks
  * Workflow task detail includes fields: Assigned To, Subject, Due Date, Status and Priority.
* Send Emails:
  * Daily limit of 1,000 emails can be sent per Salesforce license per organization.
  * Daily limit of 2,000,000 emails can be sent organization wide.
* Field Updates:
  * Record Owner can be updated.
  * Optionally, all workflow rules on the same object can be re-evaluated after a field update.
*Outbound Messages:
  * Data from specified fields are sent in XML format via an API message.
* Select Existing Action:
  * Can use existing actions either in Immediate Workflow Actions or Time-Dependent Actions.
* Immediate Actions:
  * If multiple actions are defined, the order of execution is not guaranteed, but field updates execute first.
* Time Dependent Actions
* Time Trigger:
  * Workflow rule is already active (must deactivate, add time trigger, then activate again).
