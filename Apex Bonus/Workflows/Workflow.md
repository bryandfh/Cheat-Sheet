# Workflow and Process Automation

### Order of execution:
A helpful way of remembering the basics is Very Angry Admins Work Pretty Efficiently :pencil: :
* Very => Validation Rules
* Angry => Assignment Rules
* Admins => Auto-Response Rules
* Work => Workflow
* Pretty => Process
* Efficiently => Escalation Rules

### Workflow Rules Evaluation

* When a record is created.
* Created, and everytime it's edited.
  * The rule will fire every time the record is updated even though the record may have already met the workflow criteria.
* Created, and any time itâ€™s edited to subsequently meet criteria:
  * When a new record is created, or if an existing record is changed from not meeting the rule criteria to meeting the criteria, the workflow rule will fire.
 
### Rule Criteria and Formula Evaluations
It's the logic to determine if the rule should fire. There are 2 ways to define the logic: Criteria are met or Formula evaluates to True.

#### Criteria Are Met
Filter logic with AND,OR,NOT operators.

#### Formula Evaluates to True
The formula return True or False. If True, then the rule is triggered.

### Workflow Capabilities
Workflows and approval processes include the capability to generate the following types of actions:

* Create Tasks
  * Workflow task detail includes fields: Assigned To, Subject, Due Date, Status and Priority.
* Send Emails:
  * Daily limit of 1,000 emails can be sent per Salesforce license per organization.
  * Daily limit of 2,000,000 emails can be sent organization wide.
* Field Updates:
  * Record Owner can be updated.
  * Optionally, all workflow rules on the same object can be re-evaluated after a field update.
*Outbound Messages:
  * Data from specified fields are sent in XML format via an API message.
* Select Existing Action:
  * Can use existing actions either in Immediate Workflow Actions or Time-Dependent Actions.
* Immediate Actions:
  * If multiple actions are defined, the order of execution is not guaranteed, but field updates execute first.
* Time Trigger:
  * Workflow rule is already active (must deactivate, add time trigger, then activate again).
* Time Dependent Actions

### Lightning Process Builder

It's similar to standard workflow but with more powerful. One of the main limitations with Process Builder compared to Workflows is it cannot send outbound messages. Use for if/then requirements.

#### Process Definition
At a high level, a process definition consists of the following steps:
* Select one of the options for starting a process:
  * A record changes
  * A platform event occurs
  * It's invoked by another process
* Define the object for the process.
* Define the criteria when it will run.
* Define the activities that need to be automated.
* Activate the Process.

### Process Builder Actions
* Apex
  * To invoke an Apex class that exists in the org. Ideal for getting complex calculations done or to trigger another code based business process
  
* Create a Record
  * To create a new record of any related or unrelated object

* Email Alerts
  * To invoke an email alert configured in the org. The email alert must also be configured on the same object as the process being defined.

* Flows
  * To invoke a Flow that is already defined in the org. Ideal for performing operations that includes getting a user input / deleting records / updating un-related records etc. Also, Flow can be scheduled on a certain frequency.

* Post to Chatter
  * To make a post onto Chatter. Process Builder Chatter action can be configured to post the message to a User / a Chatter Group / or in context of the record Chatter feed. While defining the message template, @ mentions topics and merge fields can also be defined.

* Processes
  * To select an invocable Process Builder process. Helpful for when there are many repeated steps.

* Quick Actions
  * To invoke a Quick Action that is defined in the org. Can be used to invoke quick actions that creates a record update a record or logs a call. Both Global Action and Object Level actions can be invoked.

* Quip
  * To include standard Quip actions such as send message in chat or document, add members to chat or document, etc.

* Send Custom Notification
  * To send a notification with a custom message to selected recipients. There must be an existing notification type to be able to use this action type.

* Send Survey Invitation
  * To send email survey invitations to leads, contacts, and users. There must be an active survey to be able to use this action type.

* Submit for Approval
  * To submit the record in context for approval. Process Builder gives the option to choose which approval process to use and who to submit it as.

* Update Records
  * To update the record or related records of the specific record in context.
