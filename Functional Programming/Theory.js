/*
Functional programming is an approach to software development based around the evaluation of functions. 
Functions in programming map input to output to produce a result. You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more and more complex programs.
The functional programming approach breaks a program into small, testable parts.

Functional programming follows a few core principles:
1) Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation
2) Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data
3)Functions have minimal side effects in the program

Functional programming is about:
1) Isolated functions: There is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
2) Pure functions: The same input always gives the same output
3) Functions with limited side effects: Any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

Callbacks:  Are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function.
First class function: Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value. In JS
all function are first class functions
Higher order functions: Functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value
